# the-fate-book

## Description
In this challenge we started with no code, I looked at previous assignments and added the folders I thought I would need. Tried to look at the mini project alot and pull from it, also used the later assignments that had to do with CRUD opperations. In our instructions for the assginent we built up the models first namely the User and Thought models. Both of these models had virtuals user corresponging to friend count and thought corresponding to reactions. I belive I started by running an install on express and mongoose, though they may have just been copied for the weeks assingments into the package.json. Learned alot about the different ways you need to set up models
